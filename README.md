## Revisions
workout-tracker_v1.0 - Initial commit: Added basic README and .gitignore files.

workout-tracker_v1.1 - Created api-routes.js and established functional getLastWorkout route, which is called upon initial page load of index.html.

workout-tracker_v1.2 - Fixed Total Workout Duration data input by adding a tallyDuration function, which sums all existing exersise durations for the last workout.

workout-tracker_v1.3 - Added functionallity to the New Workout button in index.html.

workout-tracker_v1.4 - Added functionallity to the Continue Workout button in index.html. User is now able to create a new workout or continue their last workout (by adding new exercises), while successfully updating the database.

workout-tracker_v1.5 - Added route to the stats page. Stats page seems functional, need to investigate for bugs.

workout-tracker_v1.6 - Connected app to Heroku with mongodb as database.

workout-tracker_v1.7 - Eliminated cardio workouts form the pounds lifted section.

## Bugs
Clicking on New Workout, initiates a new workout model in the database, so if the user leaves the create page prematurly the database will then contain an empty workout.

User can submit empty add exersise form which should be prevented to keep junk entires out of the database
